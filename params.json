LODSPeaKr allows you to publish your data in several machine-processable syntaxes (RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples) as well as in HTML.\r\n\r\n### Why another system for publishing LOD?\r\n\r\nThere are several alternatives available, however I needed a system that:\r\n\r\n* Was fast and simple to install.\r\n* Flexible on what to show for each type of resource.\r\n* Customizable interface for humans.\r\n* Written in PHP.\r\n\r\n### How do I install LODSPeaKr?\r\n\r\nIn order to use LODSPeaKr, you only need Apache + PHP5 + Git (optional but highly recommended). It also makes use of [ARC2](https://github.com/semsol/arc2) and [Haanga](https://github.com/crodas/Haanga) (included in LODSPeaKr). There are several ways to install LODSPeaKr. Probably the easiest is to open a terminal and run\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash < <(curl -sL http://lodspeakr.org/install)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand follow the instructions. For more information, please go to the installation page and check the requirements if you don't get your system working after completing the installation process.\r\n\r\n### Ok, what's next?\r\n\r\nYou can check the [Requirements needed](https://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr/wiki/Installation) to make LODSPeaKr work, as well as some information about [other ways to install it](https://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr/wiki/Installation). Once everything is working, you can take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr/wiki) in general or go directly to the most basic pages:\r\n\r\n* How to [create components](https://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr/wiki/Creating-components-in-LODSPeaKr)\r\n* Understanding [models](https://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr/wiki/Models) and [views](https://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr/wiki/Views)\r\n* How to [use results](https://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr/wiki/How-to-use-results)\r\n* How to [use filters](https://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr/wiki/Filters-in-LODSPeaKr)","tagline":"Linked Open Data Simple Publishing Kit","note":"Don't delete this file!
